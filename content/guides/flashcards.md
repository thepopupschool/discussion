[Flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) in combination with a [Spaced Repetition](https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition) system are a fun and effective way to learn.

## Using Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is one of the most famous spaced repetition apps.
On this site, you can find downloadable and importable Anki decks generated from each [flashcard](/tags/flashcard).

Anki supports all operating systems and has an app for the web and for smartphones. They all have an option to import files that end with `.apkg`, which means to say "I am an Anki deck file and you can import me."

You can also create an account on https://ankiweb.net/account/signup and have all your flashcards synced between your devices, if that is what you need.

Here is a short video on how to import an Anki deck on macOS for AnkiWeb.
