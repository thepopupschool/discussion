## Action Protocols 
A kind of inner form that directs bodily activities, existing in different levels or grades in different living beings and all other animate entities which behave in accordance with purposes or goals, executing their degrees of freedom, as they tend toward relationships in the natural order. They are "internal metabolic signatures of the external world".

## Habitas 
The internal meaning or sense that is made by an actor. It is composed of action protocols.

## Habitat 
The activities in the habitat are local and participatory. The actions taken have an immediate, direct effect on the internal state of the actor, catalyzing sense-making processes.

## Metabolism 
Internal activity.

## Signature 
Specific and reflective of the external activity. Essentially it is a direct participation, fractal relation.

## Action Potentials 
Commonly known in neuroscience, action protocols in brain cells (the neurons) are very similar to what is commonly known in neuroscience as action potentials. The action protocol of a neuron is shaped by its relations within a global ecosystem.

## Sense-making up-hierarchy 
Local agents are sensing and reporting up-wards as actions taken. As the information “rises” toward a centralized processing region, information becomes more global but also more generalized, eventually reaching a context that is coherent.
