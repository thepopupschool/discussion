Facing Latency

# Individuation

Individuation is a process of becoming whole. If you reflect on how compartmentalized your reality is and how fragemented your self is, how split you are from past and future, how culturally fixed we are, how separated we are from the natural movements of our bodies and the generative processes of the earth --- you can imagine how extraordinary it might be to "individuate." Individuation is not like becoming an island unto oneself. But individuation is also not clinging to relationships. Individuation is beyond both the autonomous self and the self with belonging needs. There is a new kind of confidence that you are an ongoing process of the natural intelligence of the universe – a continuous unfolding of reality *in the each present moment.* The self is seen as latent – the emerging edge of the generative forces of the universe.

> *From which vantage point could you get behind your own latency?*

When I taught the MA in Consciousness Studies and Transpersonal Psychology, I used to show the following clip from the movie *Guess Who's COming for Dinner*. It tells the story of a black man and white woman who want to marry meeting each other's parents. The clip begins with Sidney Poitier's character arguing with his father, because his father doesn't approve of bi-racial marriage.

**What do you see ?**

This is just the first layer of individuation. We must individuate from our parents. We must learn how to stand on our own two feet. The best parents, the best mentors, teach you how to stand on your own two feet. That's the first iteration of individuation.

---

Because the self is seen *as latency*, as projecting into the future, the role of the person becomes shaping the self-generating process towards the future they would like to see. Individuation is a kind of shape-shifting, or transmutation process. You don't stay put, because you are always en-forming and in-forming.

This has little to do with "progress" as modern people think of it. It has to do with dynamic rhythms and universal tempos --- we come and go, and we are coming and going at the same time. You are both: as flux and flow.

# The New Human

> *Do you want to be software?*

There is something in the Zeitgeist of modern humans that wants to transform into ... some thing else. Here is one techno-future option that is being pushed by many powerful tech giants, and being pursued by many others.

There may be one or more branches waiting to appear in human evolution. That is the nature of *latency* at the macroscale. There may be a major extinction ahead, totally eliminating "our branch of the tree." But we still unfold from the deeper universals --- our shared genealogy which is represented by the trunk of the evolutionary tree. What happens when we understand this more completely?

This is not a problem of "who am I becoming?" but a question of "who are we becoming" and, given that context, "who can I be?" ... It is a matter of coming to face latency directly, in the eyes of the others, human and non-human.

Unfortunately, I forgot to record the session after the breakout; then David and Phoebe came in at the end (mistaking the starting time) and we recorded a short discussion with them. I have written some "show notes" for what we talked about after the breakout

<iframe width="100%" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mk_0at0wMDs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Some notes of what we talked about:

- People realized that all four "future zones" are actually happening now and at the same time.
- There was a need to define what "conscious evolution" means, whether, for example, that means transcendence of the human condition or a more deeply rooted relationship with the body and nature.
- Zone 1 (accelerated tech and regressed conscoiusness) was the least attractive scenario, leading to the world in the film "The Matrix"
- An evolved consciousness would build different kinds of technologies, use them for different puposes and ends, and probably design them at human scale
- There are two possibilities from a "pragmatic optimist" perspective --- either consciousness leaps ahead and creates a "fifth attractor" for others to follow, or technological acceleration will burn itself out, along with burning out our current consciousness, forcing a new mind to emerge
- All species will overshoot their environment if nothing pushes them back. In healthy, natural ecosystems, other species and forces maintain a balance. There are cyclical population explosions and collapses, due to predation, drought, and certain pathogens that cycle through populations when they get too dense (ex: bats). Humans may be "pushed back" by the very forces of nature, and by the very future we most fear. This means that the balance we need the most may require the (short term) future we fear the most.
- Either people are nature and nature is self-terminating; or people are nature and nature is not self-terminating; or people are not nature, and represent a terminal threat to nature
