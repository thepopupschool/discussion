# Up Hierarchy

## What term does John Heron use to describe how people make collective meaning together?
Up-hierarchy.

## What is the definition of "sensemaking up-hierarchy?"
Distributed sensing that leads to collective sensemaking, where decision choices are reported upwards as actions taken, rather than downwards as instructions to be followed.

## Instead of using terms like "lower" and "higher," what terms can be used to create a wave-like action unfolding mental model?
Proximal and distal.

## What terms does process philosophy suggest using to avoid the connotations of "earlier" and "later?"
Prior and posterior.

## What additional term can be used with prior-posterior, enabling us to stretch the wave out into successive, overlapping phases?
Latent

## What is important to remember about an up-hierarchy and a holarchy?
An up-hierarchy is not a holarchy.

## What happens to the agency at the proximate levels in an up-hierarchy when it switches to a down-hierarchy?
It is subsumed (given over to/taken over by) by the agency at the distal layers.

## What happens when we think that increasing the complexity of our thought is a way to understand the natural world?
Complex thought is very far along the distal end of the sensemaking up-hierarchy, and therefore moves us further away from understanding the actual interactions and outcomes we have with the natural world.

## What is more relevant to our lives than the thought that sums up our life with story?
The immediate embodied disposition we cultivate moment to moment.

## What should guide us instead of rule us?
The self-to-self encounter.

## Give an example of how parts and wholes can be confusing.
The seed that is part of the tree is not the same as the seed that is the whole that the tree grew from.
In built things, parts are prior to the wholes (e.g., you must have lumber before you can build the house).
In generative, organismic processes, the whole is prior to the parts, and wholes evolve from prior wholes.
