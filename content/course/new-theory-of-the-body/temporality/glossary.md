## Duration 
Each instance of conscious existence. Meditative awareness stretches the duration across more of the epoch.

## Epoch 
The entire two-beat pattern, a whole-part relation and universal principle of a cosmos continuously becoming-into-being.

## Microgenesis 
A process theory of experience, where the microgenetic processes of human experience reflect a deeper universal generative principle of the creative cosmos. It describes waves of experience arising from primordial levels and reaching thresholds.

## Temporality 
Waves of experience arising from more primordial levels, reaching and passing various thresholds.

These terms relate to previously defined concepts:

## Action Thresholds 
Sensations of bodily disposition or “mood” become subconscious affect-laden drives above a certain threshold. Action thresholds relate to temporality, as temporality involves waves of experience reaching and passing various thresholds.

## Sense-making up-hierarchy 
The sequence of events is too simplistic to describe the micro- generative process of experience. A fully functioning sensemaking up-hierarchy goes from affect to perception and flow towards actions that satisfy.

##  Habitas 
Involves internal relations.

## Habitat 
Involves networks of external relations.
