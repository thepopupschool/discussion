# Temporality


## What interaction metaphors have been presented previously in the series
Sense-making up-hierarchy, Habitat/Habitas, Action Protocols, and Action Thresholds.

## What two terms are important for understanding temporality of experience
**Duration** and **epoch**.

## How should we imagine temporality
As waves of experience arising from more primordial levels, reaching and passing various thresholds.

## What happens above a certain threshold regarding bodily disposition or “mood”
The inchoate sensations become subconscious affect-laden drives.

## What happens above a certain threshold regarding subconscious affect-laden drives
They become elaborated by story and become emotions.

## What happens above a certain threshold regarding the emotions
They trigger speech acts and other behaviors.

## What happens above a certain threshold regarding the limbic system
It can become overwhelmed, and a cascade of disregulated, disruptive events ensue.

## What does Jason W Brown use to describe a process theory of experience
The term **microgenesis**.

## According to Brown, what do the microgenetic processes of human experience reflect
A deeper universal generative principle of the creative cosmos.

## In the context of microgenesis, what does the overlap of waves account for
The continuity of process in the heart of the experience of discrete moments.

## In the illustration provided, what does the entire two-beat pattern constitute
An **epoch**.

## In the illustration provided, what does each instance of conscious existence constitute
A **duration**.

## According to Brown, what kind of relation is the epoch-duration
A whole-part relation.

## What happens to meditative awareness
Stretches the duration across more of the epoch.

## What happens in heightened states of perceptual acuity like kensho or satori
There is a phase shift in the opposite direction, such that the conscious perception is simultaneously present with the upswell of its becoming in which the startling beauty of reality arises, and time itself is lost, along with the sense of self which relies on it.

## What do meditative absorptions such as the jhanas do
Postpone the duration to varying degrees until, in the deepest states, only unconscious processing remains without any shift in phase.
