## Abstract concepts and deep thinking

-   📝 Marie's use of the phrase "Social imaginary" in her report is both brilliant and fitting, showcasing her insightful thinking.

-   🧠 The goal of Collective Insight practice is to release the epistemic constraints and expand our thinking in order to create a compelling origin story.

-   🌈 "Bridges made of rainbows, rainbows, Whirlpool right, petri dish, space deforming" - The speaker explores abstract concepts and imagery, suggesting a connection between different elements of the universe.

-   🧠 The body evolved to process information and provide insights, but relying solely on talking and words is not enough to solve problems and gain new insights.

-   🌍 The practice of Collective Insight encourages us to look beyond the duality of life and death and explore the deeper nature of reality, potentially leading to surprising and transformative insights.

-   💭 The idea of justifying constraints in language and the concept of death being "just starting with the other side of the other hand" raises questions about the animistic and existential nature of human communication.

-   ⚡️ "Every thing is dying and being born from death ever since the beginning."

## Personal experiences and connections

-   🐴 The speaker's experience of living with donkeys in the Redwoods brought them a unique and joyful connection that they still cherish.

-   😄 The speaker expresses a tremendous happiness and a sense of awe while being in a different place, highlighting the unique experience and atmosphere.

-   😮 The experience of listening to the video was described as shapes, folds, and pulses, highlighting the unique and abstract nature of the content.

-   🤔 Magdalene's ability to stay focused and not let her thoughts become a whole script is a valuable practice in achieving success.

**Ah.. and it occurred to me that a cat and death appeared in a poem I wrote years ago:**

cool, sahweetness, arising like the perpetual cat at breakfast, sipping cool sahweet milk

even angels need reminding why they preferred to be born

once, twice, thrice, a thousand times over

mommies and daddies, babies born alive, and babies born dead

the tantric dirt rises up and swallows us all

effort less leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

this too is living

this too is dead

being here over there

is bard ooooooooooo

crossing over, like the slip

undressing the woman

in your dreams

is Love.

Remember tho

Not to make too much of it,

Not to give it too much life

And not enough death.

Bee instead, in the grass

Among the flow ers

Sipping nectar, stealing pollen

Out of gratitude for the sun

That great pavilion of iridescence

Up there, where we look for God.
