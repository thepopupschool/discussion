## Perspectives on Creation and Existence

-   🤔 The idea of God as the largest compound individual offers a modern perspective on the concept of creation, suggesting it is an internal process rather than an external force.

-   🌍 The concept of Collective Insight suggests that the universe itself engages in a form of collective intelligence, where ideas and insights are shared and built upon.

-   🤔 The speaker reflects on reclaiming the origin story, emphasizing the importance of understanding and connecting with our own personal "river" in life.

-   🌊 The process of collective insight is an exercise in another way of being, allowing for relationality and gaps that allow life to flourish.

-   🤔 The meaning of language is not solely in the words themselves, but rather in the shared understanding and context between individuals.

-   🐵 The abilities of an illiterate deaf mute human who hasn't learned to sign can surpass those of a chimpanzee due to our polyphasic nature and curiosity about others.

## Education and Learning Approaches

-   📚 Children should learn in somatic and mimetic ways, connecting with their core self, and then progress to learning in memetic and gestural ways, such as watching and imitating others.

-   📚 School should take advantage of the cognitive strength of middle school students by telling history and science through storytelling and mythic stories.

-   🌍 The power of binary stories: They start with binaries to problematize them and make the child's mind think about what to do with that tension.

-   🧠 Children have a narrow window of time in which they possess superpower-like language learning skills that outperform adults, and we should focus on augmenting and maximizing this stage of development.
