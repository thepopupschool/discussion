# Habitat and Habitas

## What two terms help us understand the idea that everything is interconnected?

Habitat and habitas.

## What is the root of the words "habitat" and "habitas"?

"Dwell."

## The beaver depends on the pond (habitat) to live. How does the pond depend on the beaver?

The beaver's actions (habitas) help create and maintain the pond.

## Where is the habitas located?

It is internal. In the beaver example, it is the collection of action protocols partially embodied through interaction with the habitat and partially through behavioral instincts.

## Where are a beaver's instincts located?

Yes and no. Yes, because we can observe them in the beaver's body/brain. No, because the beaver's body is a habitat for other members with their own internal habitas.

## How does the author describe the deep continuity of life?

All members are active agents, interacting with and enacting their habitatThey also build unique and situationally intelligent action protocols, which internalize their habitat.

## How does observing a tree change the observer's internal habitat?

When a person sees a tree, it creates a cascade of actions in their body at microscopic scales, such as neurons trying to find each other and connect.

## How does the tree observation example demonstrate habitat and habitas?

The person's interaction with the tree (habitat) changes the habitat where their neurons seek to connect. The habitas of the neurons change individually and collectively.

## What happens to the observer in the tree example if they develop affection for the tree?

They develop new action protocols as a result of the interaction and infolding of the tree within them.

## Briefly explain the difference between habitat and habitas as understood in process relational philosophy?

Habitat is constituted by external relations, while habitas is constituted by internal relations.

## Which philosopher critiqued Nagarjuna's symmetrical understanding of emptiness and form?

Charles Hartshorne.
