### Habitat
The dwelling or environment of an organism. In the context of this text, habitat refers to the external relations and environment that an organism interacts with.

### Habitas
The in-dwelling or internalized experience of an organism's environment. It is the collection of action protocols and embodied responses shaped by an organism's interaction with its habitat.

## Asymmetric mutual dependency
The idea that while entities are interdependent, they depend on each other in different ways. For example, a child depends on a parent differently than a parent depends on a child.

### Action protocols
Internalized patterns of behavior and responses that guide an organism's interaction with its environment. They are shaped by both instinct and experience.

### Enactment
The process of actively shaping and creating one's environment through interaction and experience.

### Infoldment
The process of internalizing and integrating aspects of the external environment into an organism's internal experience.

### Co-origination
The Buddhist doctrine that emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all phenomena.
