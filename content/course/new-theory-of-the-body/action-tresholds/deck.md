# Action Tresholds

## What are action *protocols* described as in relation to the external world?
Internal metabolic signatures of the external world.

## What concept is introduced in the "Action Thresholds" article?
Action *thresholds*.

## What is happening among the internal relations (habitas) of entities and beings in any given moment?
Trillions upon trillions of action protocols operating at different spatial and temporal scales.

## What two actions are part of the "two-step dance" of sense-making?
Actions at one scale unfold new external relations, while actions at another scale infold new action protocols.

## How do actions contribute to the whole?
Most contribute to the background potential state, while only the few, stronger and coordinated actions reach above a threshold.

## What happens when actions reach above a threshold?
Activities at the deeper level become realized as action-taken at the higher scale.

## What can a realized action be?
Merely consciousness of something--- like a shift in mood, or worrisome thought--- or can be a movement that makes a sound or propels the animal.

## What does the new awareness, thought, sound making or movement constitute?
The new context at the apex of the sense-making up-hierarchy, a context that in turn creates a global update “headed back down”.

## What happens below a certain threshold?
The perceptual event is not something the child experiences but susbsists as latent potential in the codex of the action potentials.

## What do the sum total of action protocols compose?
*Complex potential state*s.

## How can we think of the potential state?
As “subsisting” on one side of an event horizon, and the actual realized state as existing on the other side of it.

## What is the potential state described as?
A stream brimming with pluripotentiality.

## According to William E. Connolly, what happens to potentials that are not selected?
Those not selected are in a sense “left behind,” but they are not eliminated, and remain available for future vibrations.

## What does this pluripotentiality constitute?
The numinous causal field.

## What would correctly situate the body within the field of possibility and its role as a causal agent?
A New Theory of the Body.

## Why is there a "sense-making crisis" today?
Because we are separated from our body and nature --- the lving ground and origin of all sense-fullness.
