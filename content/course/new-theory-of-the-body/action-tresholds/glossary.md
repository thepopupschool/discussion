## Action Thresholds 
Stronger and coordinated actions reach above a threshold where the activities at the deeper level become realized as action-taken at the higher scale.

## Action Protocols 
Internal metabolic signatures of the external world, functioning to make sense of it for the person. In any given moment, for any given individual, there are trillions upon trillions of action protocols operating at different spatial and temporal scales among the internal relations (habitas) of the entities and beings who are sensing and acting in their local habitat (networks of external relations). Habitas is composed of action protocols.

## Complex potential states 
The sum total of action protocols.

## Potential State 
Can be thought of as subsisting on one side of an event horizon, with the actual realized state existing on the other side. It is a stream brimming with pluripotentiality flowing toward action.

## Pluripotentiality 
Constitutes the numinous causal field.

## Sense-making up-hierarchy 
Realized action can be a movement, thought, or awareness that constitutes a new context at the apex of the sense-making up-hierarchy and creates a global update "headed back down".

## Habitat 
Networks of external relations.

## Habitas 
Internal relations of the entities and beings.
