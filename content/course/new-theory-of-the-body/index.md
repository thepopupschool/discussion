**Dear Friends of the POP-UP School,**

We are about to embark on a journey, an exploration, and a challenge --- on our way to discover, through inspiration and insight, *a new theory of the body.*

The idea of a new theory of the body came to me as an insight on the Respond Network's [MAPLE](https://www.monasticacademy.com/) [event this summer](https://open.substack.com/pub/bonnittaroy/p/wisdom-as-a-force-of-nature?r=108vl&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web). We were asked to come up with a hypotheses and questions around "what is wisdom." At the end of the exercise, my mind was burning with the question

> If wisdom comes from the body, do we need a new theory of the body to account for it?

I realized that the purpose of a new theory of the body--- a purpose aligned with everything we do in this school--- would mean that the theory would have to show the deep continuity of mind, body and world. Make no mistake. This will not be a theory of *emergentism*, which I have argued in a [previous post](why-we-need-a-school-like-this), actually sets a divine gap between nature and human, body and mind.

> The sense of separation comes not despite the term, "Emergence" but with it. This is because "emergence" means something like "a miracle happens here" --- a placeholder where no other explantory theory is possible. It is this miracle--- reminiscent of the hand of god--- that separates us. A divine gap that cannot be mended.

It occurs to me now, that *emergentism* also sets an unbridgeable gap between human and the Divine. We need a theory, an understanding, that connects and heals – makes and mends (makes ammends)
