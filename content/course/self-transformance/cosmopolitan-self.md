We can distinguish the selves by the processes through which the potential unfolds. The **core self** unfolds and expands the pre-egoic evolutionary potentials of the affect-laden, sensorimotor core. The **communal self **unfolds and expands the pro-social potentials of the human group/ community.

The **cosmopolitan self**, by contrast, is a product of global socio-cultural evolution and global economic expansion. It relates to what David Chandler [^1] talks about as the *production of subjectivity* by the systems that shape the material conditions of people.

Consider, for example, if you live in a society where you foraged for your food in the wild, the weather was clement, and you could easily create shelter. These conditions would produce *a certain kind of subjectivity*.

Consider instead you live in a society based on AI-controlled social credit system. This would produce a totally different kind of subjectivity.

Following Chandler and others [^2], the notion here is that the **cosmopolitan self** is the new kid on the block, the one that increasingly occupies our social imaginary.

> [!note]
> In this course we will explore the conditions of the production of subjectivity, take a critically-reflective attitude toward the neoliberal subject and its hold on the cosmopolitan self, and imagine alternative conditions that shape alternative selves at planetary scale**.

- All major social transformations (phases of civilization) are associated with human migratory patterns
  - pastoral/ nomadic/ hunter-gatherer migration patterns
  - pre-agricultural trade routes
  - agricultural revolution - rural communities
  - industrial revolution - metropolis and urban flight
  - cybernetic/knowledge revolution - mega-cities and digital nomads
  - meta-modern (integral?) - ??
  - multi-planetary migration ?
- Human migratory patterns create new conditions for the production of subjectivity
- What are the migratory patterns of humans today?

**The point in this course**, is not to debate what the principles and policies of the cosmopolitan world should be. Rather we are posing the question of how this cosmopolitan subjectivity came to be in the first place...

-   Were you perhaps riding on the road to Damascus, as a non-believer, a pilgrim or stranger in a strange land, when suddenly your head was pierced by a bolt of lightning, and when you came to, you saw up there, on the top of the hill, the shining Cosmopolis?

-   Or did the idea of a cosmopolitan subject seep into your consciousness like a worrisome virus that slowly but surely established a new shroud of normalcy over the world?

-   Perhaps the cosmopolitan subject has been established in your imagination the way a nursery rhyme gets stuck in your head and creates variations through time. Where once there was a gingerbread house and a wicked woman, or a coven of bears, or a grandmother displaced by a wolf lying in her bed--- now you see these were all actually symbols standing in for the Cosmopolis and the cosmopolitan subject of the future?

-   Or perhaps, it was nothing so dramatic as that. Perhaps the cosmoplitan idea was actually invented by a powerful machine that kept churning out random threats and grievances that over time, took hold over the entire world, and out of these *globally shared complaints*, a cosmopolitan version of the self emerged to address them?

**Is this a tech thing?**

Perhaps Cosmopolitanism is afforded by the digital revolution, and the blockchain technologies that will make a "one-world" possible after the collapse of centralized banking?

> No, that will not work either. The problem with Bitcoin is not just its fixed supply. It is the presumption that the rate of change of the money supply can be predicted and foreshadowed within any algorithm. That the money supply can be de-politicised. So, it is not a question of how sophisticated and complex the algorithm is. It is, rather, that a purely political, unknowable, process can never, ever, be captured by an algorithm. It cannot and, therefore, it should not. [^3] \
