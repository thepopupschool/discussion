The next two sessions of the Cosmopolitan Self Course will spend more time on small group dialogue around the question of the human collective. Here are the videos we will be working with next. They are short enough so we will watch them at the beginning of the session. But if you can’t come in on time, or don’t want to wait for the session recording, here are the links to the session and the videos

This is a video we will be referencing for the second session of our cosmopolitan self course. If as a paid subscriber, you are taking the course, please try to find 3 hours to watch this video.
The video is important enough that I wanted to share it with all members of the POP-UP School. Nate Hagens is a very good speaker, he runs through his presentation with power and speed, so you get both a clear and comprehensive picture of the message which is:
The bad news is: everything we are doing to combat climate/civilization collapse is not working. The good news is, the answer is simple: reduce consumption, de-growth the financial incentives.
For those in the course you will notice that the “simple answer” requires the production of a new subjectivity.
So here you go:

Hey folks. Due to time constraints — quick turn-arounds— I just uploaded the raw video files. You will have to advance through the break-out periods. Also apologies that my mic is so loud! I’ve lowered the gain, and try to make sure its in the right position before I start a session.
I also want to say how much I enjoy these sessions, learning together makes it possible to really dive into hard questions, and be able to look with eyes wide open. Comment away!
