## Course proposal:

In 2019 I received a small funding to write a book on a Philosophy of Transformational Education. Most of the content of this course will be a continuation of that work. One of my research goals in this book was to redefine education as "performing an alchemy of potential."

I started working with a model of the self that does not merely follow developmental stage processes. Rather, I see the self as a multi-dimensional system of potential states, with semi-autonomous, and semi-interdependent processes of transformation.

In my work I identify four centers of transformational potential:

- The Core Self: non-egoic evolutionary potentials that explore and organize (and re-organize)self-other-world
- The Communal Self: the transpersonal self that interpenetrates with other selves
- The Cosmopolitan Self: the participatory, world-building activity of the self
- The Psychedelic Self: the porous, unbounded, intuitive self, as "horizon of pure potential"

Each center appears to take priority in different life stages, according to cultural "prompts" like school and career, but in reality, each center has the potential for transformations across the lifespan. My vision for education is that all the transformational potentials of the self are supported through embodied practices.

Embodied practices have always offered the highest transformative potentials in both eastern and western cultures, throughout ancient as well as modern times. While ideas can change behavior, only embodied action sources evolutionary change. Therefore, embodiment represents the higher leverage point for alchemical transformation of human history. Therefore each module focuses not only on a philosophical approach, but is accompanied by embodied practices that lead to deepening insight and expanded awareness.

**Why the term "transformance?"**

I borrow the term "transformance" from Diana Fosha's AEDP (accelerated, experiential dynamic psychotherapy) method, which emphasizes the positive psychodynamic resources of the self that traces an arc from crisis through healing, to a state experience of "core state and truth sense" --- which implies a state of high experiential trust:

> Core state refers to an altered state of openness and contact wherein individuals are deeply in touch with essential aspects of their own experience. Experience is intense, deeply felt, unequivocal, and declarative; sensation is heightened, imagery is vivid, focus and concentration are effortless... The affective marker for core state is the truth sense. The truth sense is a vitality affect whose felt sense is an aesthetic experience of rightness, the rightness of one's experience.

She describes the "arc of transformance" as

> The emotion-based transformational process, unfolding through the directional thrust of emotion, moment to moment kept on a progressive track by vitality affects signaling the operation of recognition processes, describes an arc: A psychoevolutionary perspective at one end is organically linked with aesthetics, spirituality, and the quest for personal truth at the other. The experiential processing of emotions shaped by eons of evolution, naturally culminates in experiences of aliveness, hope, faith, clarity, agency, simplicity, compassion, coherence, and both truth and beauty.

**Moving from a psycho-therapeutic approach to an "education-across-the-lifespan" approach.**

While incorporating some of the modelling of AEDP, my intention is to shift from the perspective of the "healing" arts to the perspective of change as the ongoing transformation of potentials, drawing on A Theory of Complex Potential States. This is work that includes Dan Brown's "Three Pillars" model of comprehensive attachment repair, primarily by focusing on the second and third pillars: "Fostering a Range of Metacognitive Skills" and "Fostering Collaborative Nonverbal and Verbal Behavior."

**Who is this course designed for?**

Although the theory behind the course is dense, the course itself (like all POP-UP School courses") are designed to be playful, embodied and provocative--- leading to insights in places where you might not expect them! Multi-media presentations and simple, but powerful practices, along with local discussion groups, provide a solid basis to stretch your own potentials, access higher states of perception, intention and joy, and discover choices that create positive feed-loops in your life.

**This course is your portal out of the COVID-ERA FUNK.**

Replace your obsession over decline and collapse with concentration on transformation and potential. Like the story of the two wolves --- the one who survives is the one you feed.
